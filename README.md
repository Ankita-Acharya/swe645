This was to set up static web page on Amazon S3. This is the home page which is deployed on S3. I also tried out this w3 template to enhance the look and feel.
The second part was to put up the dynamic web page and deploy on the tomcat server on EC2 instance of amazon. 

Very basic web hosting on Amazon s3.
